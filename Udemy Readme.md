**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Udemy Courses Data**

**Project Overview**

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python in a Jupyter Notebook to analyze Udemy course data. The analysis aims to uncover insights into course offerings, instructor performance, pricing trends, and learner preferences on the Udemy platform. By exploring this dataset, the project seeks to identify key patterns and trends that can inform course creation, marketing strategies, and platform development.

**Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Course Analysis:** Examine the distribution and characteristics of courses offered on Udemy, including course categories, ratings, and enrollment numbers.
1. **Instructor Insights:** Analyze the performance of instructors based on metrics such as course ratings, number of courses, and student reviews.
1. **Pricing Trends:** Investigate pricing strategies, including course prices, discounts, and their impact on enrollment and ratings.
1. **Student Preferences:** Explore learner preferences by analyzing course ratings, reviews, and completion rates across different categories and topics.
1. **Geographical Insights:** Assess the geographical distribution of course enrollments and ratings to identify trends in different regions.
